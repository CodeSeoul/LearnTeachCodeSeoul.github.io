		<h2>Stuff We Do</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Learn programming fundamentals</strong> through a variety of languages and platforms together in small groups or pair programming -- everything from short tutorials to day-long hackathons/learnathons!</li>
			<li><strong>Workshops</strong> -- build something tangible and learn new skills in our structured group classes!</li>
			<li><strong>Co-working and casual learning</strong> - work on your own projects independently while enjoying the company of like-minded people.</li>
			<li><strong>Discussion groups</strong> for language-agnostic topics (book club, anyone?)</li>
			<li><strong>Project show-and-tell</strong> -- get feedback, generate ideas, or just show off your mad skillz!</li>
			<li>And other random, fun activities like geeky movie nights and joint events with other meetups!</li>
